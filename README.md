# Magic-Squares
Code for solving normal Magic Squares of any size n > 2.

The typical (or normal) magic square consists of consecutive integers (starting with 1 and ending with nÂ²) placed into 'n' rows by 'n' columns so that all rows, all columns and both diagonals sum to the same total.

This code solves all possible inputs n > 2 by breaking the input into one of three general cases:
  - n is odd ::: Solution: http://www.1728.org/magicsq1.htm
  - n divisible by 4 ::: Solution: http://www.1728.org/magicsq2.htm                   
  - n divisible by 2, but not 4 ::: Solution: http://www.1728.org/magicsq3.htm
